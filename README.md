### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 4th-year student of Management Information Systems at Osmaniye Korkut Ata University.  
I am conducting consumer-oriented studies in the fields of Data Science and Marketing.  
I enjoy working on people-oriented projects and learning about human psychology.  
I have been actively involved in projects and trainings in the fields of software, hardware, statistics, and marketing, interacting closely with our esteemed faculty members throughout my education.  
Apart from my academic life, I have had the opportunity to participate in many different projects as a freelancer.  
I strive to learn and share new information every day by combining all these curiosities and interests with data.  
It has always been my dream to add value to our world, education, and humanity. Now, working towards my dreams makes me proud.
