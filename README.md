### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 As a Data Scientist, I specialize in extracting insights from data to drive decision-making. With
 expertise in machine learning, data analysis, and statistical modeling, I create solutions that
 align with business objectives. I utilize tools like Python, MSSQL, Power BI, Qlik View, and Qlik
 Sense to uncover valuable insights from complex datasets. My experience spans
 telecommunications, finance, and marketing, where Iâ€™ve applied techniques such as customer
 segmentation, sales forecasting, recommendation systems, and A/B testing.
