### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I study Consumer-oriented fields, specializing in Data Science and Marketing, with a passion for 
understanding human psychology. Throughout my education, I actively participated in projects and 
training sessions covering software, hardware, statistics, and marketing, collaborating closely with 
faculty. I've also engaged in various Freelancer projects, gaining valuable experience. Combining my 
diverse interests with data, I strive to learn and teach daily, aiming to make a meaningful impact on 
education and humanity.
