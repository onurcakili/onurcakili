### Hi there 👋

 As a Data Scientist, I specialize in extracting insights from data to drive decision-making. With
 expertise in machine learning, data analysis, and statistical modeling, I create solutions that
 align with business objectives. I utilize tools like Python, MSSQL, Power BI, Qlik View, and Qlik
 Sense to uncover valuable insights from complex datasets. My experience spans
 telecommunications, finance, and marketing, where I’ve applied techniques such as customer
 segmentation, sales forecasting, recommendation systems, and A/B testing.
